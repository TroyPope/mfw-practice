        <h3>I'm a local journalist. I didn't go back to college until I was 26 when I realized retail was a dead end. I've always liked learning new things. I've taught myself video editing and newspaper layout by watching YouTube videos. I was looking to hire a journalist who also did coding, but I found it a challenge. Initially I thought that I could learn the material to be able to go a different direction with who I needed to hire. After I started learning, I realized how I could fill the niche role I was looking to hire -- for someone else. So I want to learn as much as possible to more opportunities open up for me. </h3>
